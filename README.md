# popular-movies-stage2

In this stage I’ll add additional functionality to the app I built in Stage 1.


I’ll add more information to your movie details view:

- I’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- I’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- I’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). 
- I’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
